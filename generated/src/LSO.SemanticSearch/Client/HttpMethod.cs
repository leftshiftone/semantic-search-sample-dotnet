/*
 * Semantic Search - Searcher HTTP API
 *
 * The searcher component HTTP API of the semantic search Service.  The service depends on a database backend. If a mere vector store (e.g. [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)), instead of a full fledged search engine (e.g. [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)), is configured, some advanced functionalities of the API have no effect. This is noted where appropriate, referring to the former as _simple database_ and the latter as _full database_.
